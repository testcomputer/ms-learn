Microsoft Intune is an all-in-one management platform designed to manage, protect, and
monitor all of your organization's endpoints. These endpoints encompass a wide range of
devices, including mobile devices, desktop computers, virtual machines, embedded devices, 
servers, and shared devices. Some examples of shared and specialized devices that fall
under the endpoint category include retail point of sale devices, ruggedized devices, 
digital interactive whiteboards, conference room devices, and holographic wearable computers.
Additionally, endpoints also include the applications used by your organization

Understand Windows Autopilot

Enrolling devices in Intune is made easier with Windows Autopilot. By providing enrollment details 
beforehand, new computers can be configured for business use with just a few clicks after being powered 
on for the first time. Windows Autopilot also allows for device resetting, repurposing, and recovery. 
Utilizing cloud-based services, devices can be automatically joined to Azure AD, enrolled into MDM services 
like Microsoft Intune, have restricted access, be assigned to configuration groups, and have customized 
Out-of-box-experience (OOBE) content tailored to the organization.


By using a collection of cloud-based technologies, Windows Autopilot:

    Reduces the time IT spends on deploying, managing, and retiring devices.
    Reduces the infrastructure required to maintain the devices.
    Maximizes ease of use for all types of end users.

From the user's perspective, it only takes a few simple operations to make their device ready
to use. The only interaction required from the end user is to connect to a network and to verify 
their credentials. Everything beyond that is automated.
